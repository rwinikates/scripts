## What is this

These are just scripts I use for my own personal automation. Probably not that useful to anyone else, unless I specifically direct you to one of them as an example of how to do something

## Bing

"Bro, you use bing?" Yeah. They have a rewards program that I've automated to make the most of. [Feel free to lift these and use them yourself](https://www.bing.com/explore/rewards?PUBL=REFERAFRIEND&CREA=RAW&rrid=_c9feb5ad-3d7c-e93f-884c-9221f773aa60) (referral link, since I already did the hard work for you, you can at least give me a little credit, right?)

## Craigslist

I sell stuff I no longer need/want on Craigslist. These scripts help me repost/renew listings automatically.

## What is this

These are just scripts I use for my own personal automation. Probably not that useful to anyone else, unless I specifically direct you to one of them as an example of how to do something

## Tools used

* [iMacros](http://imacros.net/overview): Firefox browser scripting
* [Windows Task Scheduler](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/schedule-task): executes .bat files to trigger the iMacros in Firefox.  My work machine is windows, and is always on, making it ideal to trigger things in an unobtrusive manner (e.g. at night/over weekends) 

## Bing

"Bro, you use bing?" Yeah. They have a rewards program that I've automated to make the most of. [Feel free to lift these and use them yourself](https://www.bing.com/explore/rewards?PUBL=REFERAFRIEND&CREA=RAW&rrid=_c9feb5ad-3d7c-e93f-884c-9221f773aa60) (referral link, since I already did the hard work for you, you can at least give me a little credit, right?)

## Craigslist

I sell stuff I no longer need/want on Craigslist. These scripts help me repost/renew listings automatically.
